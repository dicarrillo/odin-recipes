        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This creamy one-pan lemon garlic chicken and asparagus comes together quickly enough for a weeknight, but it is special enough for guests. The creamy sauce makes it perfect to serve with fettuccine or rice; a tossed salad and some great bread are nice additions.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Italian herb seasoning</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup minced shallots</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into thirds</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated pecorino Romano cheese</li>
            <li>Fresh flat-leaf parsley sprigs for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a 1-gallon resealable plastic bag, combine flour, Italian seasoning, red pepper, salt, and black pepper. Move ingredients around in the bag to mix well, and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place chicken pieces between 2 sheets of plastic wrap on a cutting board. Pound the breasts to a uniform thickness of about 1/2-inch, and blot dry with paper towels.
            </li>
            <li> Add chicken pieces to flour mixture, seal the bag, and shake until all chicken is lightly coated.</li>
            <li>
                Melt 1 tablespoon butter with olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat,. When butter stops sizzling and the pan is hot, carefully add chicken pieces. Lightly brown each side, cooking 4 to 5 minutes per side. Remove chicken to a plate and keep warm.
            </li>
            <li>
                To the same skillet, with the drippings, add remaining tablespoon butter, shallots, and asparagus pieces. Cook, stirring often, about 3 minutes, or until asparagus is tender and bright green. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in cream, lemon juice, and pecorino Romano cheese; stir until cheese is melted, about 1 minute. Nestle chicken back pieces into the pan and cook until sauce is thickened and chicken is heated through, about 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Garnish with fresh flat leaf parsley, and serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
