            <p>
                This creamy one-pan lemon garlic chicken and asparagus comes together quickly enough for a weeknight, but it is special enough for guests. The creamy sauce makes it perfect to serve with fettuccine or rice; a tossed salad and some great bread are nice additions.

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    In a 1-gallon resealable plastic bag, combine <span class="food">flour, Italian seasoning, red pepper, salt</span>, and <span class="food">black pepper</span>. Move ingredients around in the bag to mix well, and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place <span class="food">chicken pieces</span> between 2 sheets of plastic wrap on a cutting board. Pound the breasts to a uniform thickness of about 1/2-inch, and blot dry with paper towels.
                </li>
                <li> Add <span class="food">chicken pieces</span> to <span class="food">flour mixture</span>, seal the bag, and shake until all <span class="food">chicken</span> is lightly coated.</li>
                <li>
                    Melt 1 tablespoon <span class="food">butter</span> with <span class="food">olive oil</span> in a large skillet over medium heat. When <span class="food">butter</span> stops sizzling and the pan is hot, carefully add <span class="food">chicken pieces</span>. Lightly brown each side, cooking 4 to 5 minutes per side. Remove <span class="food">chicken</span> to a plate and keep warm.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To the same skillet, with the drippings, add remaining <span class="food">tablespoon butter, shallots</span>, and <span class="food">asparagus pieces</span>. Cook, stirring often, about 3 minutes, or until <span class="food">asparagus</span> is tender and bright green. Stir in <span class="food">garlic</span> and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir in <span class="food">cream, lemon juice</span>, and <span class="food">pecorino Romano cheese</span>; stir until <span class="food">cheese</span> is melted, about 1 minute. Nestle <span class="food">chicken back pieces</span> into the pan and cook until sauce is thickened and <span class="food">chicken is heated through, about 3 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Garnish with <span class="food">fresh flat leaf parsley</span>, and serve warm.</li>
